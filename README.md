My OverTheWire: Natas Solutions
===========

This is a GitHub repository to house all the code that I have written for the [OverTheWire: Natas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CT7ujrwtnsM&list=PL1H1sBF1VAKWM3wMCn6H5Ql6OrgIivt2V) YouTube videos that I have created on my [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/johnhammond010) channel. 

Admittedly the files are not very well organized -- they should just be the script associated with each level and hopefully you can piece together what other files are needed for some levels on a case-by-case basis.

If you have any questions, feel free to check out the [video series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CT7ujrwtnsM&list=PL1H1sBF1VAKWM3wMCn6H5Ql6OrgIivt2V) or e-mail me at [johnhammond010@gmail.com](mailto:johnhammond010@gmail.com)!
